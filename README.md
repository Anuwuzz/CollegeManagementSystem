# üè´ **College Management System** 

## Overview
**Collage Management System :**  The College Management System is a microservices-based project designed to streamline and automate various operations within a college. The system is divided into multiple services, each handling a specific aspect of college management, such as student records, faculty details, courses, and feedback. The frontend is built using React.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.


##  Project Architecture
- **Frontend (React.js)**: The frontend serves as the user interface for the College Management System, enabling users to interact with various features and services. React.js is chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to build reusable UI components.
- **Student Service (Node.js)**: Manages student-related data and operations, such as registration, profile updates, and course enrollment. Provides APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.
- **Faculty Service (Node.js)**: Similar to the Student Service, the Faculty Service handles faculty-related data, including personal details, course assignments, and schedules.
- **Course Service (Spring Boot)**: Manages course information, such as course creation, updates, and enrollment processes.
- **Feedback Service (Flask)**: Collects and processes feedback from students and faculty regarding courses, facilities, and overall college experience. Implements logic for analyzing feedback and generating reports.
- **Service Registry (Eureka Server)**: Acts as the central service registry for all microservices, enabling dynamic discovery and communication between services.
